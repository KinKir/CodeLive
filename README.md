# CodeLive

CodeLive is a cross-platform collaborative code editor, designed to be a robust tool to teach programming languages in a class without the need of a bigger screen.

CodeLive gives developers the ability to run code on multiple devices using docker -for now, it can only run HTML and others will be added soon-.
